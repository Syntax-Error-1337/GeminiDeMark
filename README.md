## 📖 About The Project

**GeminiDeMark** is an advanced, privacy-focused tool developed to verify and remove visual watermarks from images generated by Google's Gemini AI. 

As AI-generated content becomes ubiquitous, the need to distinguish between human-made and AI-generated media—and occasionally to restore watermarked images for legitimate use cases—has grown. GeminiDeMark bridges this gap by providing:

1.  **Verification**: It analyzes image metadata to confirm if an image was generated by Gemini.
2.  **Restoration**: It uses a specialized client-side engine to remove the visual watermarks applied by Gemini, returning a clean image.
3.  **Privacy**: Unlike many online tools, the core image processing happens **locally in your browser**. Your images are not uploaded to our servers for processing; only the results (metadata) are tracked for your dashboard history.

Whether you are a researcher, developer, or digital artist, GeminiDeMark provides a professional dashboard to manage your converted images, track usage, and ensure content authenticity.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🛡️ Privacy-First Architecture**: Your photos stay on your device. Processing is done via client-side logic.
- **🔍 AI Metadata Detection**: Instantly identifies "Made with Google AI" metadata signatures.
- **✨ Visual Watermark Removal**: Efficiently removes the visual logo overlay from Gemini-generated images.
- **📊 Professional Dashboard**: Track your conversion history, data usage, and subscription status.
- **🌍 Multi-language Support**: Fully localized in English, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Hindi, Russian, Arabic, and more.
- **⚡ Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS v4, and frame-perfect animations.
- **🔒 Enterprise-Grade Security**: JWT authentication, AWS/SendGrid email integration, and secure database management.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

You can run GeminiDeMark in two ways: **Locally** (for development) or via **Docker** (for easy deployment).

### 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v20 or higher)
- **npm** (v10 or higher)
- **MySQL** (v8.0) - *Only for local development*
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - *For Docker deployment*

---

### 💻 Local Development Guide

If you want to contribute or modify the code, follow these steps to run the Backend and Frontend separately.

#### 1. Database Setup
Ensure you have a MySQL server running and create a database (e.g., `watermark_db`). You can use the provided schema:
```bash
mysql -u root -p watermark_db < backend/schema.sql
```

#### 2. Backend Setup (API)

The backend handles user authentication, database interactions, and usage tracking.

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Configure Environment:
    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    - Edit `.env` and fill in your MySQL credentials, JWT secret, and Email headers.
4.  Start the Development Server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    > The backend will run on `http://localhost:5001`.

#### 3. Frontend Setup (Next.js)

The frontend provides the user interface and client-side processing engine.

1.  Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend-nextjs
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Configure Environment:
    - Create a `.env.local` file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env.local
        ```
    - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` points to your local backend (e.g., `http://localhost:5001/api`).
4.  Start the Frontend Server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    > The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 🐳 Docker Deployment (Recommended)

For a production-ready setup or a quick start without installing Node/MySQL locally, use the provided CI/CD scripts.

1.  **Navigate to the CI/CD directory**:
    ```bash
    cd cicd
    ```

2.  **Environment Setup**:
    - The deployment script will automatically copy your `backend/.env` file if it exists. 
    - Ensure your `backend/.env` has the correct `DB_HOST` set to `db` (the docker service name) instead of `localhost`.

3.  **Run the Deployment Script**:
    ```bash
    ./deploy.sh
    ```
    
    **What this script does:**
    *   ⬇️ **Pulls** the latest images or builds them from source.
    *   🔐 **Generates** self-signed SSL certificates for Nginx (stored in `nginx/certs/`).
    *   🚀 **Starts** the entire stack:
        *   `frontend` (Next.js)
        *   `backend` (Express API)
        *   `db` (MySQL 8.0)
        *   `nginx` (Reverse Proxy & Security)

4.  **Access the App**:
    *   Open your browser and visit `https://localhost` (Accept the self-signed certificate warning for local testing).
